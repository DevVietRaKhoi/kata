# Week 0004

This week you will be doing a basic sample interview question for an event management company. Aim to write efficient and reusable code.

## Event Guests

Now you are in event management business. You have 2 events taking place on the same day, at the same time. You noticed some guests registered for both events and want to notify them so they can pick either of the events.

1. Input

    ```
    fname,lname,email
    Bob,Dylan,bob.dylan@abc.com
    Bill,Gates,bill@xyz.com
    ...
    ```

    * There is 1 CSV file for each event
    * All CSV files contain valid data
    * Names and emails do not contain comma `,`
    * Names and emails are case-insensitive
    * Some highly esteemed guests have interesting names: O'Reilly, da Gama, van Derks, ...
    * All foreign names are transliterated to English. Don't worry about Vietnamese, Chinese or Russian ;)
    * One guest can have only one email

2. Output

    ```
    Bill Gates <bill@xyz.com>
    Bob Dylan <bob.dylan@abc.com>
    ...
    ```

    * Print the guests who registered for both events in the format above
    * Note that there are no more `,` in the output and emails are wrapped in `<>`
    * Sort the guests by first name and then by the last name, and then by email

    ```
